Helping people could endangered species		Mon. July 15, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

In parts of Rwanda, dry seasons are becoming longer and more intense. To find water, local people are trekking deep into Volcanoes National Park.

Advani: “When they do this, they often set snares. The snares are for bush meat, but oftentimes they'll end up catching mountain gorillas as well. And mountain gorillas, there's only about 1,000 individuals left, so losing even just one individual, it's a really big deal.”

Nikhil Advani of the World Wildlife Fund says he and his team looked at how climate change affects endangered animals.

Advani: “What we quickly realized is that the biggest threat to a lot of these species probably comes from humans and how humans are being affected by climate change.”

So they launched a program called Climate Crowd. They work with Peace Corps volunteers and NGOs with staff in remote areas. The partners conduct interviews to learn how locals are responding to climate change, and how that, in turn, affects wildlife.

That information can be used to develop solutions.  In Rwanda.... 

Advani: “…they installed rainwater harvesting tanks. And these accumulated enough water during the wet season that it helped get them through the dry season without having to enter the park.”

So as the climate changes, helping people can help wildlife, too.

Christian author sees climate change as a moral issue	Tue. July 16, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Scott Rodin was raised in Wyoming as a conservative evangelical Christian. As a child, he learned to love nature, but also to steer clear of environmentalism. He associated it with liberals and atheists. So as an adult, he was skeptical of global warming. 

But then Rodin pursued a PhD in theology. And as he immersed himself in religious studies, he reflected on what it really means to be a steward of the earth. 

Rodin: “Caring for God's creation is one of the most important mandates that he gave us as his children. But when I looked at how I lived that out, I always just kind of gave it lip service and went on.”

He started to scrutinize his reasons for being skeptical about climate change, and he realized…

Rodin: “None of them were biblical. None of them were coming out of my faith convictions. They were political. They were sociological. And I thought, you know what? There’s something wrong with this picture.”

So Rodin decided that he had to start speaking and writing about climate change and better stewardship of the earth. He shares many of his essays in an online blog. 

Rodin encourages other conservative Christians to reflect on their values too… and, like him, conclude that climate change is a critical moral and religious issue.

Could we use sand or concrete as batteries?	Wed. July 17, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

The sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow, so energy storage is key to getting the utility grid to rely more heavily on renewables.

But batteries are expensive. So one company is experimenting with storing energy in sand – because it’s cheap and readily available.

Jason Miller is engineering manager at Echogen Power Systems, a company that uses heat energy to generate power. 

Building on its existing technologies, Echogen is developing a new system to convert electrical energy into heat, and then transfer that heat into large silos of sand or blocks of concrete.

Miller: “So we’re taking electricity from the grid to create a thermal reservoir or heat source. That heat source can then later be used as the energy input to a power cycle to generate electricity on demand.”

The company’s been awarded a $3 million federal grant to develop and test this approach.

Miller says the system would not be as efficient as lithium-ion batteries. But, because it relies on cheap materials, it could lower the cost of long-term energy storage. 

And that could help utilities send solar power to the grid…  even when the sun is not shining.

States move to regulate HFCs		Thu. July 18, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

To provide cooling, most refrigerators and air conditioners use refrigerants called HFCs. When this type of gas escapes to the atmosphere, it traps heat. 

Grumbles: “It’s a super polluting greenhouse gas.”

…. more than a thousand times more potent than CO2.

Ben Grumbles, Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment, says getting rid of HFCs is important for the climate... and doable.

Grumbles: “There are alternatives to HFCs that are climate friendly and still get the job done.”

Three years ago, more than a hundred countries agreed to reduce the use of HFCs. But the Trump administration has not submitted the agreement to the Senate for ratification, and is attempting to roll back other HFC regulations. 

So several states have taken matters into their own hands. Washington and California have passed laws to limit HFCs, and Maryland, New York, and Connecticut have also committed to developing regulations. 

Grumbles: “States have significant authority and ability in working with citizens and businesses and communities to make real progress, and sometimes that hits a threshold where the federal government is then convinced to move forward as well.”

A surprisingly cost-effective zero-energy house	Fri. July 19, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Paul Torcellini’s Connecticut home may look like a traditional bungalow. But there’s an important difference:

Torcellini: “It is a zero energy house. We produce more energy onsite than we consume in the course of a year.” 

As an engineer at the National Renewable Energy Lab, Torcellini has seen lots of tiny, zero energy homes. But he wanted a more conventional size. 

Torcellini: “You know, we’re like, we can do this with a family. We can do this taking five showers or baths a day, and all the laundry that goes with it, and four chest freezers so we can grow and store our own food.”

To provide that energy, he installed solar panels. And to keep heating and cooling needs low, he designed the home with south-facing windows and twelve-inch walls that provide tight insulation… all without breaking the bank.

Torcellini says going zero energy no longer means drastically altering a building’s budget, size, or style. If a community wants to build a zero energy school, for example…

Torcellini: “You'll have multiple architects, engineers saying, ‘I can do that, and I can do it at no additional cost.’ So cost is not the excuse anymore. Technology is not the excuse. It's the will to just do it.”

Pennsylvania farmer puts his pigs to work	Mon. July 22, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

When Homer Walden and Dru Peters started their Pennsylvania farm, the husband and wife team was on a tight budget.

Walden: “We spent all our money on purchasing our farm.”

But Walden loves to tinker.

Walden: “That’s my specialty … you know, I’m constantly looking at what we do day-in and day-out and trying to keep the cost down.” 

So he developed inexpensive ways to do s nome of his farm chores. 

For example, he built portable pig pens that he can pull over a new patch of land every day. The pigs eat weeds and churn up the ground underneath. 

Walden: “Pig tiller, is what I call it. I also call it pulled pork.”

After the pigs, Walden puts chickens on the land. They eat bugs and enrich the soil with their waste. 

So when it’s time to clear a patch of land for planting, Walden does not need a tractor or chemical fertilizers.

His methods are cheap – and reduce carbon pollution. In 2012…

Walden: “We were given the governor's award for environmental excellence by not using a drop of fossil fuels.”

Walden is now teaching others about his low-tech, low-carbon farming methods. 

Walden: “I don't think we can help anybody just by considering our own benefits from these ideas, and it’s my quest to share what I’ve learned.”

Nonprofit builds an army of climate lobbyists	Tue. July 23, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Many people who are concerned about global warming want their elected officials to enact policies to reduce carbon pollution, but they may not know how to influence lawmakers.

So the nonprofit Citizens’ Climate Lobby – or CCL –teaches people how to lobby their legislators.

Danny Richter, CCL’s Vice President of Government Affairs, knows that meeting with elected officials can be intimidating.

Richter: “I remember the first time that I went lobbying, I was very intimidated. And what I found was that despite what TV shows and movies may lead us to believe, members of Congress and their staff are regular people. They're real people and they're approachable.”

To help volunteers feel prepared and confident, CCL provides trainings that include mock lobbying sessions. 

Richter: “So our trainers will go and they will pretend to be a member of congress or an aide, and that really goes a surprisingly long way to demystifying the process.”

Richter says that when CCL volunteers finally lobby for real, it can be a transformative experience.

Richter: “They're so excited because for the first time in their life, their democracy is real to them. They have for the first time exercised their citizenship to its fullest extent.”

Heat waves are a threat to public health		Wed. July 24, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

On a sweltering summer day in New York city, low-income people may suffer the most - especially in public housing. The tall brick buildings absorb heat, there is little green space, and many people do not have air conditioning. 

Ahmed: “You have extreme heat and people who don't have access to air conditioners … and it's unbearable.”

Lubna Ahmed is with a Harlem-based nonprofit called WE ACT for Environmental Justice. She says extreme heat is not just uncomfortable. It can be dangerous.

Ahmed: “Dehydration and things like that are just scratching the surface. I’m talking about chronic health conditions that somebody may have that are then exacerbated by the heat…”

…such as asthma, heart disease, and diabetes. 

During heat waves, New York city opens cooling centers in libraries and other public buildings. But a lot of people do not know about them. So WE ACT has developed signs to direct people to the cooling centers. 

WE ACT also advocates for programs that help people afford AC at home because sick people or the elderly may not be able to get to a cooling center.

And for them, the ability to stay cool could be a matter of life or death.

Son of coal country now manages wind farms	Thu. July 25, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Winds of change are blowing in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Once coal country, the area is now home to more than sixty giant wind turbines.

For local resident Lee Van Horn, the change is welcome. 

Van Horn: “I was so used to growing up and seeing the scarred land around in this area, and I knew the coal industry. it just wasn't good for the environment.” 

Van Horn also knew it was risky for miners. He’d heard stories from his father who worked underground as a young man.

Van Horn: “He seen people hurt, you know, maimed.… there were a lot of hazards in that industry for sure.”

So Van Horn pursued a career in electrical engineering instead. For more than twenty years, he worked for the telecommunications industry. In 2006…

Van Horn: “They were starting to build a wind farm not very far from my house. From an engineering standpoint, it really fascinated me on how these things operate and how they can put out power.”

So Van Horn applied for a job at Avangrid renewables… and got it. Today, he is manager of the company’s two local wind farms.

Van Horn: “I was just so happy to get involved with green energy… and I just think we're just making a big difference here.”

Polluted neighborhood turns farm into a green space	Fri. July 26, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections… 

In a neighborhood of Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Mountain View, kids play next to fossil fuel facilities, junkyards, and manufacturing plants. 

Lambert: “This is in their backyard… not only their backyard, their front yard!”

Kim Lambert is an environmental justice manager with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. She says Mountain View residents are fed up with industrial development and the pollution that comes with it.

So when an old farm came up for sale in 2012, residents were determined to create green space for the community. They partnered with nonprofits and the government to turn the 570 acres along the Rio Grande into the Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge. 

Now it’s becoming habitat for birds and other wildlife. It will also absorb stormwater runoff. So as heavy downpours grow more common, the refuge can help reduce flooding in the nearby community. 

Industry still dominates Mountain View. But Lambert says the refuge provides green space – and a bit of hope.

Lambert: “There are places where people could have picnics, there are educational opportunities, and thousands of people now come to tour the refuge. It’s a benefit for all.”

Farming a forest — and helping the climate	Mon. July 29, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

On ten acres near Washington, D.C., Lincoln Smith grows food – but he does not plant in large tilled fields or tidy garden rows. He farms in the forest.

Smith: “There is plenty of nutrition that can be derived from a more diverse forest-based agricultural system.”

In his forest garden, Smith grows trees that produce edible nuts and fruits, such as persimmons, mulberries, and paw-paws. The trees grow alongside mushrooms, greens, and perennial berries.  

Smith: “…black raspberries, blueberries, currants… you name it.”

Smith also designs forest gardens for others - even in urban and suburban areas. He says planting small forest gardens not only provides more locally-grown food, it increases the tree canopy.

Smith: “So we're providing better wildlife habitat. We’re of course sequestering carbon in the trees themselves and in the soil organic matter that is accumulating year over year as you grow the forest. And then with the healthy soil comes clean water, because the water that falls on that site is going to filter through that soil before it goes into the stream – in stark contrast to, of course, a parking lot or a tilled field.”

So with forest gardens, people can grow food and help protect the climate, all on the same patch of land.

Miami Beach is trying to save its historic buildings	Tue. July 30, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Miami Beach is known for its nightlife and blue-green water. It’s also famous for the pastel art-deco buildings from the twenties and thirties that line the oceanfront boulevard in South Beach.

Torriente: “They're a very important part of our history and really the, you know, the flavor of Miami Beach.”

Susy Torriente is the city’s Chief Resiliency Officer. She says that as seas rise, these and other historic buildings in Miami Beach are at risk of flooding.  

There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Relocating electrical equipment might be enough to protect some buildings. But in other places, whole homes may need to be elevated.

Torriente: “…and that is allowable, and doable, but it’s expensive.”

So Torriente says not every structure can be saved. 

The city has convened a team of architects, urban planners, and coastal engineers to identify which buildings are most endangered, and outline what it will take to protect them.

Torriente: “This process will also help us define what are the properties that are really considered the gems that we want to save, versus some of the properties that aren't necessarily as significant and so that’ll be a very transparent process working with our community so that we can make those decisions together.”

National Aquarium teaches climate science to visitors										Wed. July 31, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

At Baltimore’s National Aquarium, you’ll see sharks, stingrays, and jellyfish. And you’ll learn not just about the wonders of the sea – but also the threats posed by global warming. 

Racanelli: “We've made the decision at the National Aquarium to be bold in our messaging, to be honest about the evidence-based realities of climate change with our audiences.”

That’s CEO John Racanelli. He says aquarium staff are trained to interpret climate science. 

For example, they describe how carbon dioxide in the atmosphere traps heat like a blanket, which causes warmer water and rising seas. That carbon pollution also causes ocean acidification that harms shellfish. 

Racanelli says visitors are often eager to hear the science and solutions – especially kids.

Racanelli: “The kids are of course receptive but they're also persuasive around their parents,  and it's been fascinating to watch how a young climate interpreter who's talking to a couple of kids whose dad starts out with the body language of crossed arms and kind of a furrowed brow… they watch the fathers soften as they see their kids get the basic messages about climate change.”

Like memories of fish and corals, those lessons may stay with visitors long after they leave the aquarium.

Why small homes can be appealing		Thu. Aug. 1, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Real estate ads often show large houses with huge lawns, but many buyers want something smaller and more affordable. 

Wallace: “First time home buyers and retiring or downsizing baby boomers …  that is a very sizable population that is looking for smaller spaces, less maintenance, and sustainable spaces.”

Ryan Wallace is CEO of the Solar Home Factory, which makes small, energy-efficient modular homes with built-in solar panels. 

The company’s first project is a development in Geneva, New York. It will include twenty homes on one acre. The largest will be less than eleven hundred square feet.

Wallace says living in a small house does not require a spartan existence. The community in Geneva is designed to include shared spaces such as a gym, green house, and public areas. 

Wallace: “If we can take our core shelter and make that smaller, and then take our extravagancies, our luxuries, and make those shared resources, we can actually continue to live not just the lives we're living, but actually better lives.”

So he says home buyers could have more amenities while spending less and using less energy.

How ‘resilience hubs’ could protect communities		Fri. Aug. 2, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

During extreme weather, low-income communities tend to suffer the most. 

In the case of an evacuation, residents may not have a car or a safe place to go. They may live in older homes that are more easily damaged. And with less money, it’s harder to recover. 

Kristin Baja of the Urban Sustainability Directors Network says supporting these communities should not wait until disaster strikes.

Baja: “How are we actually helping communities year-round? Because resilience is not just in the event of a shock. It's all the stressors we're dealing with every day that are then exacerbated by that shock.”

Baja’s group is working with several cities, including Washington D.C. and Miami, that are interested in developing what she calls “resilience hubs.” 

The idea is to retrofit trusted spaces – such as community centers –with solar panels and battery storage. In an emergency…

Baja: “There's extra food. There's extra water. There's a location to go to charge phones or to communicate with folks.”

The rest of the year, these spaces can serve the community in other ways – for example, by offering job training workshops or health services.

She says it’s a model for strengthening communities before, during, and after a disaster.

Conservative says climate should be a priority	Mon. Aug. 5, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Some people see climate change as a liberal cause.

But David Jenkins, president of the nonprofit group Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, says it should be a top priority for conservatives too.

Jenkins: “We have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of our environment and to protect the interest of future generations … and that's what conservatism is about. It's doing what's responsible to protect society now and in the future.” 

Jenkins says over the years, fossil fuel companies and far-right libertarians have pushed republicans away from the issue. He says by doing so, they’ve left the issue to democrats, some of whom call for solutions that many conservative lawmakers oppose, such as the Green New Deal.

Jenkins: “When we conservatives fail to engage constructively on the environment and fail to produce real solutions, then by default, all the proposed solutions come from the left.”

Jenkins says there are free-market approaches, such as putting a price on carbon pollution, that can reduce emissions and appeal to republicans.

So his group is working to persuade conservatives to lead the push for climate solutions. 

Jenkins: “You don't believe in climate change and try to do something about climate change as an exception to being a conservative. You do it because you're conservative. It's part of who you are.”

Critics challenge insurance companies		Tue. Aug. 6, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

As seas rise and weather becomes more extreme, insurance companies are raising premiums for some customers in vulnerable areas. But paradoxically…

Sulakshana: “While they’re acknowledging these impacts, they’re also fueling the climate crisis.”

Elana Sulakshana of the Rainforest Action Network says the industry provides insurance that protects fossil fuel projects, for example, pipelines and coal-fired power plants.

And their involvement does not end there. Many insurers also invest in fossil fuels.

Sulakshana: “These companies collect premiums and they put that money into the stock market. They invest it. And it's estimated that they have more than $500 billion dollars invested in coal, oil, and gas companies. So it’s really a massive scale of investment in the fossil fuel industry as well.” 

So the Rainforest Action Network is part of the Insure Our Future campaign. It calls on insurers to stop insuring or investing in coal or tar sands projects. 

Sulakshana says the campaign is gaining support...

Sulakshana: “Cities, universities, foundations, nonprofits are increasingly saying to their insurers: are you investing in or insuring fossil fuels? We want to be working with a company that isn't.’”

Energy efficiency can help nonprofits serve more people											Wed. Aug. 7, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Christ House, a medical facility for homeless people in Washington, D.C., used to spend thousands of dollars a year on its old, inefficient lighting. That’s money that could have been spent on patient care.

Help came last year from the DC Sustainable Energy Utility, or DCSEU. The nonprofit helped Christ House upgrade to LED lighting. The switch should save the facility more than a $100,000 over the life of the bulbs.

Patrice Brooks manages affordable housing efficiency programs for DCSEU. She says when deciding which projects to support under its income-qualified efficiency fund, the organization considers what the cost savings can be used for. For Christ House…

Brooks: “We took a look at how many clients do they serve each year? What are they doing for the community? What type of services are they providing?”

For multi-family housing, they may consider …

Brooks: “Do you have programs that you’re running? Is there anything that you’re doing after school? Are there any community centers? Being able to help assist these communities with these energy efficient upgrades helps them overall holistically.”

She says efficiency improvements can do more than save energy. They can also save money that can be used to help people who need it most.

Hurricane clean-up can be hazardous to your health	Thu. Aug. 8, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

Last fall, Hurricane Florence pounded Robeson County, North Carolina. The rain and storm surge devastated homes and businesses. In the aftermath, residents had to deal with mold and other dangerous conditions.

But a growing number of people there now know how to safely clean up their homes. They learned through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ‘Worker Training Program.’ 

Industrial hygienist Sharon Beard, a staffer with the program, says if people do not know how to protect themselves, they may put themselves in danger. For example, they might not realize…

Beard: “…you know, I’m not supposed to really open up the refrigerators that have been sitting there for a month because they have all that stuff that's been rotting in those refrigerators. And going into homes that are structurally unsound becomes problematic, because anything can happen in those particular environments.”

Not everyone in a hurricane-prone area will be able to take a class, so the institute also provides community tools and booklets online. 

The information is especially critical as climate change brings more extreme weather.

Beard: “In order for communities to be resilient, they have to understand the hazards.”

…not just during a storm, but after as well.

How protecting a Pennsylvania stream makes the area more resilient									Fri. Aug. 9, 2019

I’m Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, and this is Climate Connections…

For more than fifty years, the Barbour family has raised beef cattle. Their Pennsylvania farm is in a pastoral setting with rolling hills for the cattle to forage – and a stream flowing through the property.

When Ted Barbour was a kid, the cattle could wade in the stream.

Barbour: “It was a continuous pastured area, so when it was wet and muddy, the cattle would trample all of the forage into the ground, and it would just be like sort of a mud hole so to speak. And when the high waters came, it washed all that topsoil down the stream.”

…but not anymore. Fifteen years ago, Barbour fenced the cattle out of the stream. He put the adjacent land into the USDA’s Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. 

The program pays farmers to take land out of production to protect the environment. Barbour created a buffer of trees and plants to stabilize the streambank and filter pollution. 

Now when it rains, the vegetation absorbs nutrients and manure before they can enter the water.

Barbour: “Let the plants absorb that and grow from that, as opposed to letting that go into the water system…  it just simply is just good common sense.”

And an important way to protect water quality as climate change brings more rainfall to Pennsylvania.
